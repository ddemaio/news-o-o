A project during [Hack Week 25](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/) aims to address community feedback by bringing popular configuration features from YaST into [Cockpit](https://cockpit-project.org/) and System Roles, which is a step toward bridging the gap left by YaST’s deprecation in openSUSE Leap 16.0. 

The initiative, titled [Bring to Cockpit + System Roles capabilities from YAST](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/25/projects/bring-to-cockpit-plus-system-roles-capabilities-from-yast), responds directly to some users anxiety about the loss of the familiar desktop and system management tools. Cockpit was introduced in Leap 16.0 as part of a broader shift toward modern, automation-friendly infrastructure. 

Many long-time users have rightly pointed out that critical YaST functionality remains missing, but the [next chapter of Leap](https://news.opensuse.org/2025/10/01/next-chapter-opens-with-leap-release/) requires a modern successor to YaST without reinventing the wheel alone; these advancements can grow stronger when shared and improved across communities.

The efforts for the [Hack Week project](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/25/projects/bring-to-cockpit-plus-system-roles-capabilities-from-yast), are set to begin Dec. 1. People can continue to work on the [list of implementations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZhX-Ip9MKJNeKSYV3bSZG4Qc5giuY7XSV0U61Ecu9lo/edit) should they choose to advance the features.

Several configuration and installation capabilities that were available in the deprecated YaST, which has long been one of the project’s hallmark tools, have yet to make it into the new Cockpit release. Significant research and careful consideration went into the transition away from YaST. Despite its deep ties to the project’s brand identity, teams thoroughly evaluated which features and modules were essential. These [gaps for Cockpit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZhX-Ip9MKJNeKSYV3bSZG4Qc5giuY7XSV0U61Ecu9lo/edit) are still being filled through community contributions and ongoing integration with System Roles.

The project’s goal is to implement service configuration in System Roles and then layer a Cockpit interface on top to give administrators direct control. In cases where an existing resource is already configured, specific Cockpit modules to handle the interaction are expected.

Should people choose to assist in the efforts, a [spreadsheet detailing the missing features and suggested implementations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZhX-Ip9MKJNeKSYV3bSZG4Qc5giuY7XSV0U61Ecu9lo/edit) has been published for contributors. Contributors can track progress and collaborate via the project’s Hack Week page.

Hack Week, which began in 2007, has become a cornerstone of the project’s open-source culture. Hack Week has produced tools that are now integral to the openSUSE ecosystem, such as [openQA](https://open.qa/), [Weblate](https://weblate.org/) and [Aeon Desktop](https://aeondesktop.github.io/). Hack Week has also seeded projects that later grew into widely used products; the origins of [ownCloud](https://owncloud.com/) and its fork [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) derive from a Hack Week project started more than a decade ago.
